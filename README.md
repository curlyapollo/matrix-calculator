# matrix-calculator
At the beginning of the program the user selects the operation that
he wants to perform. Among the available operations there are:
1. finding the trace of the matrix;
2. matrix transposition;
3. the sum of two matrices;
4. the difference between two matrices;
5. the product of two matrices;
6. multiplying the matrix by a number;
7. finding the determinant of the matrix;
8. SLAE solution by Gauss method.

After selecting an operation the program receives the necessary input data
(the dimension of the matrices and their contents), which can be generated
randomly (the parameters for generation are set by the user) or
come from a file or console. All three methods of obtaining
input data are implemented.
